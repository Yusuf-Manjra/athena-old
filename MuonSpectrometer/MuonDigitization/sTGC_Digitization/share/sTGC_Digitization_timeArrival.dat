# Characterization of the time of arrival
#
# Time of arrival is obtained from Garfield simulation. It is parametrized as 
# a function of the distance of closest approach, i.e. the shortest distance 
# from a particle's trajectory to the nearest wire.
# The approach is the following: dividing the Garfield data into 11 intervals, 
# then fit the time distribution in each interval.
# 
# In each interval, the time of arrival distribution can be described by a 
# gamma distribution with three parameters: 
#  - the usual k and theta parameters, and 
#  - t0, which is the earliest time of arrival for the interval and also the
#    only parameter that varies with the distance of closest approach.
# The gamma probability distribution function is:
#   P(t) = 1 / (\Gamma(k) * {\theta}^k) * (t - t0)^{k-1} * exp(-(t - t0) / {\theta})
# where t is the time of arrival to be selected.
#
# The current implementation in Athena uses the parameters k and theta, and the 
# most probable value of time instead of t0. First, a gamma random number 
# generator is launched to choose a time, say a value val, then it is shifted 
# by the best-fitted most probable value minus (k-1)*theta. The  best-fitted 
# most probable value (mpv) already includes t0, while the product (k-1)*theta 
# gives the most probable value of a gamma pdf begining at origin.
# In other word, t0 = mpv - (k-1)*theta for the intervals considered, except for
# the 1st interval (distance less than 0.050mm) where both t0 and mpv are 
# set to zero nanosecond. Also, mpv is parametrized as a 4th-order polymonial 
# in order to get a continuous time of arrival as a function of distance.
# So the resulting time of arrival is given by 
#       time = val + (mpv - (k-1) * theta).
#
# Below are the parameters to be read. Line starting with '#' is not read.
# IMPORTANT: the intervals must be sorted in ascending order of low_edge.
