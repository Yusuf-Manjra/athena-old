# Timing of sTGC Strip digits depends on the strip position with 
# respect to the middle strip. In a same cluster, the time offset 
# between a strip to its neighbour can be large due to the resistive 
# layer. The Strip timing is determined relative to the strip 
# located at the middle of the cluster. The time is assigned as 
# follow:
#   0 ns for the middle strip
#  10 ns for the 1st neighbour strips
#  25 ns for the 2nd neighbour strips (2 strips from the middle one)
#  35 ns for the 3rd neighbour strips
#  etc.
