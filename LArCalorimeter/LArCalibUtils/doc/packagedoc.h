@section LArCalibUtils_LArCalibUtilsIntro Introduction

This package containes the algorithms to reconstruct the LAr calibration runs
(pedestal, noise autocorrelation, ramp, delay), fill the relative electronic
calibration condition objects, and to manipulate and compute the derived
constants (e.g. ionization pulse, optimal filtering coefficients).

@todo

- A serious cleanup/update of the example jobOptions is needed.
- All the algorithms need to be migrated to configurable.
- NovaIOV support should be removed.
- Doxygen description of classes and methods is missing.
