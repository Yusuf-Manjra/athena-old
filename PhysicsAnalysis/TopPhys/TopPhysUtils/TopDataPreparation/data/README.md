# 29 Jan 2018 - Important functional update for R21

    * The files in this directory have now been moved to /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/database/GroupData/dev/AnalysisTop/TopDataPreparation.
    * Requests to update these files should proceed as usual via the ANALYSISTO Jira, but changes can now be propagated via cvmfs, rather than via new releases.
