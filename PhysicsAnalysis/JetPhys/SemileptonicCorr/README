The tool can be installed using athena (cmt config; gmake) or for standalone
purposes (gmake -f Makefile.Standalone). The former case needs to be fully 
tested. The latter saves the necessary libraries in the StandAlone directory. 

The tool is initialized as:
semilCorr* mytool = new semilCorr("inputfilename");

The input ROOT file with the necessary histograms is provided in the inputs 
directory of the package. Other arguments in the semilCorr are for debugging
purposes, and not for the average user. 

The usage of the tool is as follows:

1) get the correction from the tool (getSemilCorrToIncl), feeding it the jet (corrected for mip, jeteloss=jet-eloss) and muon vectors. The eloss 
parameterization is obtained from the AOD or D3PD and follows the direction
of the muon (and has 0 mass)
2) correct the pT of the jet for the muon (adding the full muon vector) (so jetmu=jeteloss+mu)
3) multiply that result by the correction of the tool (jetcorr=c*jetmu)

So jetcorr = getSemilCorrToIncl(jet-eloss,mu)*(jet-eloss+mu)

Systematics can be obtained with getSemilCorrToIncl. If one systematic is 
given, just that term is returned. if semilCorr::ALL is specified as
an argument, the combined systematic is returned. 

The systematic components available are:
semilCorr::TAGGINGWEIGHT
semilCorr::FRAGMENTATION
semilCorr::IDRESO
semilCorr::MSRESO
semilCorr::DECAY
semilCorr::DECAYREW
semilCorr::MUONSPECTRUM
