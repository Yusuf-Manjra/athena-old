Tracking Analysis Algorithms
============================

This package is meant to collect dual-use/analysis algorithms that are
related to tracking.

Current algorithm(s) in the package:
  - [CP::VertexSelectionAlg](TrackingAlgorithms/VertexSelectionAlg.h):
    Filter algorithm requiring a certain number of primary vertices in
    the event.
