# Standalone Analysis Algorithms

This package collects code/algorithms that are only relevant for standalone
analysis releases. So they wouldn't need to be compiled in Athena based
releases.

Current algorithm(s) in the package:
  - [CP::xAODWriterAlg](StandaloneAnalysisAlgorithms/xAODWriterAlg.h):
    Algorithm for writing mini-xAOD files as the output of analysis jobs.
