This folder can be used by developers to place local calibration files for testing before requesting them to be put in the calibration database (at /afs/cern.ch/atlas/www/GROUPS/DATABASE/GroupData/InDetTrackSystematicsTools/) . If a file cannot be found in the calibration DB, then the tools will look in this folder. Do not add files in this directory into svn/git - the point of the calibration DB is to keep large data files out of the svn repository.
