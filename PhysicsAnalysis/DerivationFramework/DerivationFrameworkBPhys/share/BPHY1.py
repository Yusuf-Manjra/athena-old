##    named "passed_"+HypothesisName. It is used later by the "SelectEvent" and "Thin_vtxTrk" tools
##    to determine which events and candidates should be kept in the output stream.
##    Multiple instances of the Select_* tools can be used on a single input collection as long as they 
##    use different "HypothesisName" flags.
