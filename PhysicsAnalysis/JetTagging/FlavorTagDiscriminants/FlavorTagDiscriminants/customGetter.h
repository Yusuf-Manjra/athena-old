  /// as inputs won't be known at compile time. Instead we build an
  /// array of "getter" functions, each of which returns one input for
  /// the tagger. The function here returns those getter functions.
  ///
  /// Many of the getter functions are trivial: they will, for example,
  /// read one double of auxdata off of the BTagging object. The
  /// sequence input getters tend to be more complicated. Since we'd
  /// like to avoid reimplementing the logic in these functions in
  /// multiple places, they are exposed here.

  /// This function will return a getter based on a string key. See the
  /// implementation for the definitions.

  /// NOTE: This function is for experts only, don't expect support.
