This package can be used to mimic the expected performance of the 
upgraded ATLAS detectors in the HL-LHC era.  Analytic functions
describe the expected detector response.  They should be applied to
truth-level particles and events.

More details on the use of specific classes, methods, and utility 
codes can be found on the following TWiki:
