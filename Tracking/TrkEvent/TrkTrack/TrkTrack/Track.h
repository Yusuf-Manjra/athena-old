     * @brief The ATLAS Track class.
     * 
     * This class is designed to work as a common track class, usable in a
     * wide variety of applications, whilst remaining as simple as possible.
     * As such, it has to be both flexible and fast. This is achieved by
     * allowing a Track to be incomplete (and in general a Track WILL be
     * incomplete).
     *
     * A Track typically is constructed via
     *
     * - A pointer to a const Trk::FitQuality  - the fit quality of a track
     * - A pointer to a DataVector of const Trk::TrackStateOnSurface
     *
     * A TrackStateOnSurface is a sub-container, which holds
     * various properties defining a Track, on a particular surface.
     * It can contain:
     * - Trk::FitQualityOnSurface
     * - Trk::TrackParameters 
     * - Trk::MeasurementBase
     * - Trk::MaterialEffectsOnTrack
     * - Trk::ScatteringAngleOnTrack
     * 
     * This class provides convenient helpers to retrieve and cache
     * DataVectors (VIEW ELEMENTs) to 
     * - const TrackParameters
     * - const Measurements
     * - const Outliers
     * from the const TrackStateOnSurface DataVector
     *
     * It also allows for retrieving/caching 
     * the Track Parameter at perigee
     *
     * The above are implemented via lazy initialization of 
     * the relevant cache employing  CxxUtils::CachedValue
     *
     *  Furthermore a Track can contain 
     * - Trk::TrackInfo
     * - Trk::TrackSummary* - used to cache the TrackSummary. Might be nullptr! 
     * 
     * const /non-const method overloads:
     *
     * None of the above can be modified for a const Trk::Track 
     * 
     * For a non-const Trk::Track  the non-const method overloads allow for
     * - Retrieving a non-const Trk::TrackInfo
     * - Retrieving a ptr to a non-const Trk::TrackSummary (can be nullptr)
     * - Retrieving a ptr to a non-const DataVector<const TrackStateOnSurface>.
     *   If elements are added/removed from this DataVector 
     *   one could possible consider calling reset() so as the previously 
     *   cached values to be cleared.
     * 
     * For the TrackSummary one still needs 
     * to use the TrackSummaryTool to create it.
     *
     * Please look at the mainpage of this package (see the link at the top
     * of the page) for more information.
