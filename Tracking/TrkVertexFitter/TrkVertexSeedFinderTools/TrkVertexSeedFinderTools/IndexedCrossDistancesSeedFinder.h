  // This class implements a seed finder for the vertexing algorithm 
  // which is based on the mean points of the distances between all tracks 
  // (taken two by two). There's actually no selection on the tracks.
  // 
  // 
  // A very similar point finder was implemented for the first time by Waltenberger 
  // in CMS. I suggest his PhD thesis (2005) as a reference for the different concepts 
  // of point finders.
