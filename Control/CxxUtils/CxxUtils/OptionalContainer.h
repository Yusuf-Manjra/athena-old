     * @brief Helper struct to allow us to partially apply the size parameter
     * to std::array.
     *
     * This class allows us to partially apply the std::array templated class
     * with only the size argument, allowing us to apply the contained type
     * typename later, completing the type.
     *
     * If this seems like an odd idea, it may be useful to approach the problem
     * from a type theoretical view, and abstract away from the cold hard C++
     * for just a moment. Specifically, we need to realize that std::array
     * (without the template parameters applied) is essentially a binary
     * function _at the type level_ (called a type constructor); it takes an
     * argument of kind (which is what we call "types" in the typed lambda
     * calculus one level above the base) typename, and a size_t, and returns
     * a concrete type. In C++ like syntax, it's a function at the type level
     * with the following signature:
     *
     * typename std::array(typename T, size_t N);
     *
     * If you're more familiar with a functional syntax like Haskell's, then
     * firstly I weep for you because trying to do any type-level computation
     * in C++ is a pain, but you may also find the following syntax more easy
     * to read (assuming DataKinds):
     *
     * std::array :: * -> Integer -> *
     *
     * Standard C++ syntax allows us to only fully apply these types, we can't
     * apply them partially (just like how we cannot partially apply normal
     * functions). In other words, we cannot pass std::array a contained type
     * only, capturing that typename in a way reminiscent of a closure, giving
     * us a partially applied type constructor with signature:
     *
     * template <typename> typename std::array'(size_t N);
     * std::array :: Integer -> *
     *
     * And we certainly cannot partially apply in the reverse order, passing it
     * a size_t for the array size and then passing it the container type to
     * get a partially applied type constructor:
     *
     * template <size_t> typename std::array''(typename T);
     * std::array :: * -> *
     *
     * However, this is something we would very much like to do. Indeed, we
     * want our optional container to be relatively type-agnostic, and for that
     * to be possible the type of our OptionalBase has to be (where C is our
     * underlying container type):
     *
     * typename OptionalBase(typename (*C)(typename), ...);
     * OptionalBase :: (* -> *) -> ... -> *
     *
     * So, for example, we could pass the std::vector type constructor as a
     * template parameter of OptionalBase directly, because it has a single
     * argument of kind typename. However, std::array does not do this by
     * default, since it has two arguments. We need to partially apply the size
     * argument before we can pass it to OptionalBase in a way that is similar
     * to the way we would pass std::vector.
     *
     * Wrapping std::array in a templated class with a templated alias allows
     * us this. Indeed, PartiallyAppliedArray has the type:
     *
     * typename PartiallyAppliedArray(size_t);
     *
     * So, for example, we can construct the type PartiallyAppliedArray<10> to
     * get a struct wrapping std::array with the size parameter partially
     * applied with the value 10. This type then contains a type alias, type,
     * or PartiallyAppliedArray<10>::type which is a unary type constructor
     * with a single argument, which is exactly what we want. So, we can now
     * pass this type directly to OptionalBase, or we can construct an array of
     * 10 integers from it by writing PartiallyAppliedArray<10>::type<int>.
     *
     * @tparam N the size of the array.
