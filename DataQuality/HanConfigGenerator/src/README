contains makefile and src to build the hc executable, for 
writing tamplate han config files from input root files ...

% hc
Usage: hanconfig [OPTIONS] input1.root ... inputN.root

    -o           FILENAME	name of output (filename required)
    -b,   --base DIR     	use directory DIR as the base for the han config
    -d,   --dir  DIR     	only directories below DIR where DIR is a structure such as HLT/TRIDT etc
    -x,          DIR     	exclude directory DIR
    -r           SRC DST 	remap directory SRC to directory DST
    -ds,  --desc DESCRIP 	use DESCRIP as the description
    -t,   --tag  VALUE   	add the VALUE to the list of command per histogram
    -wc,  --wildcard     	print use hist * rather than a separate entry for each histogram
    -dr,  --deleteref    	delete unselected histograms
    -rh,  --relocate     	relocate selected histograms
    -v,   --verbose      	print verbose output
    -h,   --help         	display this help



for instance ...

 hc hid_shifter.root -d HLT/TRIDT -x TestMon > hc.config

will take the directory structure in file eg

  hid_shifter.root

and generate a config from the directory structure hanging from 

  run_253124/HLT/TRIDT

generating the config using HLT (ie the first directory in HLT/TRIDT ) 
as the base directory, and excluding any directory with the name 
"TestMon"

To remap a name, eg suppose you have the directory SOME_STUFF in the file, 
but want this to correspond to a menu side bar item of NICE, then including 
options

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE

should do this. Any number of remappings of this sort should be possible...

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE  -r ANOTHER EVEN_NICER

The option 

   --deleteref

will delete the histograms that are not selected, so do check the 
provided configuration before using this option. It does save the
original file in FILEMAN.bak however for emergencies


** NB: If a config output file in not given in the command line it writes **
**     the config to stdout, and all other documentation and debugging    **
**     information is written to stderr                          **
