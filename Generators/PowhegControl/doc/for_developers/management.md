# Managing Powheg for ATLAS

The experts' Gitlab repository can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/pmg/mcexperts/powheg-experts/athena). It is a fork of the central Athena repository. We use it to develop the software and then open merge requests in central Athena to propagate them into releases. We use [Gitlab issues](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/pmg/mcexperts/powheg-experts/athena/issues) to track tasks and development.

## Adding new processes

See the [issues](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/pmg/mcexperts/powheg-experts/athena/issues) on Gitlab. Some information about previous work and status can be found
