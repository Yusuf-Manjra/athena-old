# Process-specific information for $`W^{\pm}Z`$ production

## Overview

The process manual from the authors can be found on CVMFS at `${POWHEGPATH}/POWHEG-BOX-V2/WZ/Docs/manual-BOX-WZ.pdf`.

## Physics configuration

### `mllmin`

This is the minimum required dilepton mass in GeV.

According to the example given in Section 3 of the manual, this is the minimum mass of the lepton pair from the Z decay. Based on that, we think that it doesn't consider e.g. the minimum mass of _any_ same-flavour, opposite-charge lepton pair, nor that it considers leptons of different flavour.
