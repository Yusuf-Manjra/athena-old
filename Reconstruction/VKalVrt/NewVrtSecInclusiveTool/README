A tool for inclusive secondary vertex reconstruction in ATLAS ID.

This is an improved version of the VrtSecInclusive algorithm.

Changes with respect to original version:

1) Outdated Graph(CERNLIB) package is replaced by Bron&Kerbosch algorithm from BOOST
2) Solving umbiquities of the track-vertex assigments in the cliques is now vertex based, not tracks based.
   Previous track-based approach can't solve all possible cases.
2) Fake(fragmentation+pileup) and hadronic interaction vertices are removed using a dedicated MVA
3) Additional material interaction rejection is based on the TrackingGeometry material layers
4) Many improvements in vertex topology resolution
5) One-track vertices are allowed (e.g. 3 track system, where one track crosses 2 others in different places, 
     so that 3-track vertex has inacceptable Chi2, will be resolved as 2-track + 1-track vertices).
     This allows to get 2 vertices in case of e.g. cascade B->D decay with 3 reconstracted tracks in total.
6) Algorithm is converted to Tool for convenience of usage in other Algorithms.

Pre-configured instances (finders) in the tool:
1) SoftBFinderTool       - looks for all low-pt (>1GeV) B-hadron vertices in event. No jet presence is assumed
2) InclusiveBFinderTool  - looks for all B-hadron vertices in event with low fake rate. 
                           Suitable for ttbar and other processes with similar pt-range.
3) HighPtBFinderTool     - looks for all high-pt B-hadron vertices in event. No jet presence is assumed.
4) MaterialSVFinderTool  - looks for hadronic interaction vertices in detector material.
5) DVFinderTool          - looks for heavy displaced vertices in ID volume.

Tool configuration options (in brackets - default settings optimised for B-hadron search)

FastZSVCut(15mm) - dZ between 2 tracks at the point of closest track-track distance in XY plane. Reject track pairs
                    which can't form 2-track vertex a priory, therefore save processing CPU.
v2tIniBDTCut(-0.7) - Cut on 2-track vertex classification BDT(B-hadron vs fakes) weight. This cut is applied 
                     at the stage of 2-track vertex finding
v2tFinBDTCut(0.0)  - Cut on 2-track vertex classification BDT(B-hadron vs fakes) weight. This cut is applied
                     AFTER final multi-track vertex  finding on remaining 2-track vertices in the final set.
cosSVPVCut(0.0)    - Cut on angle between SV-PV and summary momentum vectors of the 2-track vertex 
                     applied at the 2-track vertex search  stage
MaxSVRadiusCut(140mm)    - Evident. 
Vrt2trMassLimit(4000mev) - Reject at 2-track vertex reconstruction stage vertices with invariant mass above limit 
                           (e.g. for charm search).
VrtMassLimit       - Final multi-track vertex mass limit. Vertices with bigger mass will be stripped until 
                     its mass become smaller than the limit.
AntiPileupSigRCut(2.0) - Tracks having d0 impact significance wrt beamline smaller than the cut are removed. This rejects pileup.
TrkSigCut(2.0)     - Track selection 3D track-PV impact significance cut
CutPt(500.)        - Track selection pt cut
CutD0Max(10.mm)    - Track selection maximal track d0
CutD0Min(0.mm)     - Track selection minimal track d0. Normally the TrkSigCut should be used instead, but for some problem 
                     the explicit d0 cut might be useful.
CutPixelHits(1)    -  Required number of Pixel hits.
CutSiHits(8)       -  Required Pixel+SCT hits
CutTRTHits(10)     -  TRT hits per track in TRT acceptance |eta|<1.9
VertexMergeCut(2.) -  3D vertex-vertex distance significance, below which these vertices are checked for merging.
MultiWithOneTrkVrt(True) -  Allow saving of 1-track vertices appearing in case of close cascade vertices e.g. B->C
