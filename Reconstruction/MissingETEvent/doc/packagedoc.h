@section MissingETEvent_MissingETEventIn Introduction

The EDM is made of few and general classes that use enumerators to specialize 
data. This is suitable for ETMiss data, permits to minimize the number
of data classes and gives flexibilty to the architecture. 

The basic unit of ETMiss is made of the three vector: ExMiss, EyMiss, SumET.
